# Project Strategy & Publication Goals

This document contains the high-level strategic context for the project, including publication ambitions and anticipated challenges.

## 1. Publication Strategy & Narrative

The ultimate goal of this project is a high-impact academic publication. The narrative will be tailored based on the target journal tier.

- **High-Impact Clinical (e.g., `JAMA Dermatology`, `JAAD`):** The narrative will focus on **patient safety and health equity**, with the fairness validation on the DDI dataset as the central pillar.
- **Specialty & Technical (e.g., `JID`, `Skin Research and Technology`):** The narrative will emphasize **methodological novelty and rigor**, highlighting the D-IQM lexicon and the multi-dataset validation.
- **Cross-Disciplinary (e.g., `The Lancet Digital Health`):** The narrative will frame the work as a **foundational contribution to medical AI**, addressing the universal problem of data quality.

## 2. Anticipated Scientific Challenges

The project anticipates and has a plan to address the following potential challenges:

1.  **Challenge:** The use of dermatologist confidence as a proxy for image quality.
    - **Mitigation:** This limitation will be addressed directly in the final publication. The model's output will be framed as a clinically relevant "predictor of diagnostic ambiguity" rather than a pure technical quality score.

2.  **Challenge:** The exclusion of compositional metrics (e.g., framing).
    - **Mitigation:** This is a deliberate design choice. The "segmentation-free" approach will be presented as a strength that maximizes the tool's generalizability and ease of adoption.

3.  **Challenge:** The risk of the sharpness metric being biased against darker skin tones.
    - **Mitigation:** The DDI validation is designed to detect this. If bias is found, it will be presented as a key finding, and the project will propose a fairer alternative metric, strengthening the paper's contribution.

## 3. Development & Execution Strategy

To ensure rapid and efficient progress, the project will adhere to the following principles:

- **Iterate on a Subset:** Initial development and testing will use a small subset of the data to ensure a fast feedback loop.
- **Implement Incrementally:** Features will be built incrementally, starting with a core set to establish a baseline model quickly.
- **Parallelize for Efficiency:** Computationally expensive steps will be parallelized to minimize the final processing time on the full dataset.
