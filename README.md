# Telederm Neuroimage: An Interpretable DIQA Framework

This repository contains the source code and analysis for the project "A Robust, Interpretable, and Fair Automated Quality Control Framework for Dermatologic Images."

## Project Goal

The objective of this project is to develop and validate a lightweight, interpretable, and fair automated image quality assessment (IQA) tool for dermatology. This tool will serve as a foundational component for building safer and more equitable clinical AI pipelines.

## Repository Structure

- **/data**: Contains the raw image datasets (SCIN, ISIC, DDI). (Note: This directory is git-ignored).
- **/instructions**: Contains markdown files with high-level instructions and conventions for the AI agent.
- **/models**: Stores the final, trained machine learning models. (Note: This directory is git-ignored).
- **/reports**: Contains generated CSV files, validation reports, and figures. (Note: This directory is git-ignored).
- **/scripts**: Contains the executable Python scripts for running the data processing, training, and validation pipeline.
- **/src/diqa**: Contains the core Python source code for the Dermatologic Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) library.
