# Project Strategy, Risks, and Publication Goals

This document contains the high-level strategic context for the project, including our publication ambitions, anticipated challenges, and our plan for efficient execution.

## 1. Publication Strategy & Narrative

The ultimate goal of this project is a high-impact academic publication. The narrative should be tailored based on the target journal tier.

- **Tier 1 (High-Impact Clinical):** `JAMA Dermatology`, `JAAD`.
  - **Narrative Hook:** Frame the work around **patient safety and health equity**. The fairness validation on the DDI dataset is the central pillar of this narrative. The tool is presented as a necessary step to make clinical AI safer for all patients.

- **Tier 2 (Specialty & Technical):** `Journal of Investigative Dermatology`, `Skin Research and Technology`.
  - **Narrative Hook:** Frame the work around **methodological novelty and rigor**. Highlight the creation of the D-IQM lexicon and the robust, multi-dataset validation strategy.

- **Tier 3 (Cross-Disciplinary Digital Health):** `The Lancet Digital Health`, `npj Digital Medicine`.
  - **Narrative Hook:** Frame the work as a **foundational contribution to the entire field of medical AI**. The problem of "garbage in, garbage out" is universal, and our fair, interpretable, and pragmatic solution is a blueprint for other medical domains.

## 2. Anticipated Criticisms & Proactive Defenses

We must anticipate and address the following potential criticisms from peer reviewers:

1.  **Critique:** "Dermatologist confidence is an imperfect proxy for image quality."
    - **Defense:** Acknowledge this limitation directly. Frame our model's output not as a pure "quality score" but as a more clinically relevant **"predictor of diagnostic ambiguity."** An image that generates low confidence for *any* reason is one that warrants review.

2.  **Critique:** "The model ignores compositional quality (e.g., framing)."
    - **Defense:** This is a deliberate design choice. Frame the **"segmentation-free"** approach as a major strength that maximizes the tool's generalizability, speed, and ease of adoption by removing complex dependencies.

3.  **Critique:** "The sharpness metric may be biased against darker skin tones."
    - **Defense:** This is the central scientific risk and our greatest opportunity. The DDI validation is designed to detect this. If bias is found, the project's narrative will pivot to highlight this discovery and propose a fairer alternative metric, strengthening the paper's impact.

## 3. Lean Development & Execution Strategy

To ensure rapid progress, we will adhere to the following lean principles:

- **Develop on a Subset:** All initial coding and testing of the pipeline will be done on a small (e.g., 10%) random subset of the SCIN dataset. This ensures the development loop is fast.
- **Implement Incrementally:** The D-IQM lexicon will be built incrementally, starting with the most critical metrics (sharpness, glare, exposure) to get a baseline model working quickly.
- **Parallelize the Final Run:** The computationally expensive feature extraction on the full dataset will be parallelized across all available CPU cores to minimize the final processing time.
